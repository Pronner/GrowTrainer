# GrowTrainer
GrowTrainer is a Growtopia/GrowtopiaPS Trainer template. (with existing ban bypass, but may need to be updated)

# Updating & Versions
GrowTrainer was made using the Growtopia Version **3.78**. If you're using a version over 3.78, then you will probably have to change the Trainer's bytes and redo a few parts.
**NOTE:** I recommend learning Cheat Engine and how to use it before doing so, otherwise you'll probably be incredibly confused.

Unfortunately, GrowTrainer is currently a project that will not be continued, but a project created to set itself as a Template for others. Using this template and not changing it is completely fine, no credit is needed as well.
